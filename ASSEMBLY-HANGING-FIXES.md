# Assembly File Hanging Issue - Specific Fixes

## Problem Identified
Assembly files that **fail to open** were still hanging in SolidWorks, even though `swModel` was null. This occurred because:

1. **Partial Loading**: SolidWorks attempts to load assembly files and their dependencies
2. **Failed State**: When `OpenDoc6` fails (returns null), SolidWorks may still have partially loaded documents
3. **No Cleanup**: Previous code only cleaned up successfully opened documents
4. **Accumulation**: Each failed assembly attempt left hanging document references

## Specific Assembly-Related Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced OpenDocument Method in SWMetadataReader.cs

**Added cleanup for failed document opens:**
```csharp
if (swModel == null)
{
    // Force cleanup of any partially loaded documents
    Console.WriteLine("Cleaning up any partially loaded documents...");
    swApp.CloseAllDocuments(true); // Force close any hanging documents
    System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(500);
    GC.Collect();
    GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Catches assembly files that fail during initial metadata reading
- Prevents accumulation of hanging documents from failed opens
- Provides better logging for failed opens vs successful opens

### 2. Assembly-Specific Cleanup in CommandInterface.cs

**Added detection and cleanup for failed assembly opens:**
```csharp
if (documentType == swDocumentTypes_e.swDocASSEMBLY)
{
    ForceCleanupHangingDocuments(swApp, "Assembly failed to open - ");
}
```

**Applied in three critical locations:**
1. **ProcessFileWithDatabase** - Single file processing with BOM
2. **DisplayBom** - Interactive BOM display
3. **ProcessAllTargetFiles** - Batch processing of target files

### 3. Enhanced CloseDocumentSafely Method

**Now handles null swModel scenarios:**
```csharp
if (swModel == null) 
{
    // Check if there are any open documents that might be hanging
    int docCount = swApp.GetDocumentCount();
    if (docCount > 0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Warning: Found {docCount} potentially hanging documents, cleaning up...");
        swApp.CloseAllDocuments(true);
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Cleans up hanging documents even when swModel is null
- Provides count of hanging documents for better diagnostics
- Always ensures cleanup, regardless of document open success/failure

### 4. New ForceCleanupHangingDocuments Helper

**Dedicated method for aggressive cleanup:**
```csharp
private static void ForceCleanupHangingDocuments(SldWorks swApp, string context = "")
{
    int docCount = swApp.GetDocumentCount();
    if (docCount > 0)
    {
        swApp.CloseAllDocuments(true); // Force close without saving
        System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(500); // Give SolidWorks time
        GC.Collect(); // Force garbage collection
        
        // Verify cleanup success
        int remainingDocs = swApp.GetDocumentCount();
        Console.WriteLine($"Cleaned up {docCount - remainingDocs} hanging documents");
    }
}
```

**Features:**
- Counts documents before and after cleanup
- Provides context-specific logging
- Includes verification of cleanup success
- Reusable across all assembly operations

### 5. Batch Processing Improvements

**Periodic cleanup every 10 files:**
```csharp
if (processed % 10 == 0)
{
    ForceCleanupHangingDocuments(swApp, $"Periodic cleanup after {processed} files - ");
}
```

**Error-triggered cleanup:**
```csharp
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");
    errors++;
    ForceCleanupHangingDocuments(swApp, "Error cleanup - "); // Force cleanup after errors
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents accumulation during large batch operations
- Cleans up after any processing errors
- Maintains stable memory usage during long-running operations

## Why This Specifically Fixes Assembly Hanging

### Assembly Loading Complexity
1. **Dependencies**: Assemblies reference part files and sub-assemblies
2. **Partial Loading**: SolidWorks may load dependencies even if main assembly fails
3. **Reference Tracking**: Failed assemblies leave dangling references to loaded components
4. **COM Object Leaks**: Partially loaded assemblies don't get proper COM cleanup

### Part Files vs Assembly Files
- **Part Files**: Simple, single document, clean failure modes
- **Assembly Files**: Complex dependency trees, partial loading states, multiple COM objects

### Detection and Response
1. **Document Type Detection**: Specifically check for `swDocASSEMBLY` document type
2. **Failed Open Detection**: Check when `OpenDoc6` returns null for assemblies
3. **Hanging Document Detection**: Use `GetDocumentCount()` to detect orphaned documents
4. **Aggressive Cleanup**: Use `CloseAllDocuments(true)` to force cleanup without saving

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
- ✗ Assembly files that failed to open remained hanging in taskbar
- ✗ Multiple failed assembly attempts accumulated hanging documents
- ✗ Memory usage increased with each failed assembly
- ✗ SolidWorks became sluggish after processing several assemblies

### After Fix:
- ✅ Failed assembly opens trigger immediate cleanup
- ✅ No hanging documents in taskbar after failed opens
- ✅ Stable memory usage during batch processing
- ✅ Periodic cleanup prevents accumulation
- ✅ Better diagnostic logging for assembly-specific issues

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Failed Assembly Opens**: Try to process assembly files that are missing dependencies
2. **Batch Processing**: Process a mix of parts and assemblies, including some that will fail
3. **Monitor Document Count**: Watch `GetDocumentCount()` output in console logs
4. **Taskbar Verification**: Verify no SolidWorks documents remain after failed assembly processing
5. **Memory Monitoring**: Check memory usage remains stable during long batch operations

The fixes specifically target the assembly loading and cleanup lifecycle, ensuring that even failed assembly opens don't leave hanging document references.
