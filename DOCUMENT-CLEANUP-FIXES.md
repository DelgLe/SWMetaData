# SolidWorks Document Cleanup Fixes

## Problem Description
The application was not properly closing SolidWorks documents after processing them, resulting in:
- Multiple open document instances visible in the Windows taskbar
- Memory leaks from unclosed COM objects
- SolidWorks becoming unresponsive after processing multiple files
- Potential file locking issues

## Root Cause Analysis
The original cleanup method had several issues:

1. **Unreliable document identification**: Used `swModel.GetTitle()` which might not match the exact document name expected by `CloseDoc()`
2. **Single cleanup method**: Only tried one approach to close documents
3. **Poor error handling**: Didn't handle cases where document closing failed
4. **Inconsistent cleanup**: Different parts of the code used different cleanup approaches
5. **Missing COM object release**: Not properly releasing COM objects in all scenarios

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Enhanced Document Cleanup in SWMetadataReader.cs

**New `CleanupDocument` method with multiple fallback strategies:**

```csharp
private static void CleanupDocument(SldWorks swApp, ModelDoc2? swModel)
{
    // Method 1: Close by full path name (most reliable)
    string pathName = swModel.GetPathName();
    swApp.CloseDoc(pathName);
    
    // Method 2: Close by title (fallback)
    string title = swModel.GetTitle();
    swApp.CloseDoc(title);
    
    // Method 3: Force close all documents (last resort)
    swApp.CloseAllDocuments(true);
    
    // Always release COM object
    Marshal.ReleaseComObject(swModel);
    
    // Force garbage collection
    GC.Collect();
    GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();
    GC.Collect();
}
```

**Benefits:**
- **Path-based closing**: Most reliable method using full file path
- **Multiple fallbacks**: If one method fails, tries alternatives
- **Force cleanup**: Last resort closes all documents if individual closing fails
- **Proper COM cleanup**: Always releases COM objects and forces garbage collection
- **Better logging**: Provides feedback on cleanup success/failure

### 2. Centralized Cleanup Helper in CommandInterface.cs

**New `CloseDocumentSafely` helper method:**
- Consistent cleanup approach across all document operations
- Proper error handling and logging
- Used in all three main document processing scenarios:
  - Single file processing with database
  - BOM display operations
  - Batch processing of target files

### 3. Improved Error Handling

**Enhanced exception handling:**
- Proper try-finally blocks ensure cleanup even when errors occur
- Better error messages include SolidWorks error codes and warnings
- Separate error handling for document opening vs BOM processing

**Example in batch processing:**
```csharp
ModelDoc2? swModel = null;
try
{
    // Document processing logic
    swModel = swApp.OpenDoc6(...);
    // Process document...
}
catch (Exception bomEx)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"BOM processing error: {bomEx.Message}");
}
finally
{
    CloseDocumentSafely(swApp, swModel); // Always cleanup
}
```

### 4. Memory Management Improvements

**COM Object Lifecycle Management:**
- Explicit COM object release in all cleanup paths
- Forced garbage collection after document closing
- Proper nullable reference handling (`ModelDoc2?`)

**Resource Protection:**
- Try-finally blocks ensure cleanup even during exceptions
- Multiple cleanup strategies prevent resource leaks
- Better tracking of document open/close operations

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the fixes are working:

1. **Visual Check**: After processing files, check Windows taskbar - should not show multiple SolidWorks document instances
2. **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory usage during batch processing - should remain stable
3. **Multiple File Processing**: Process several files in sequence - each should close properly
4. **Assembly BOM Processing**: Test with assembly files that generate BOMs - documents should close after BOM extraction
5. **Error Scenarios**: Test with files that can't be opened - cleanup should still work

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Proper COM object cleanup prevents memory leaks
2. **Resource Management**: Documents are reliably closed, freeing file handles
3. **User Experience**: No more cluttered taskbar with orphaned document windows
4. **Application Stability**: Reduces risk of SolidWorks becoming unresponsive
5. **Batch Processing**: Can now process large numbers of files without accumulating open documents
6. **Robustness**: Multiple fallback methods ensure cleanup succeeds even in error conditions

## Code Quality Improvements

- Added nullable reference type handling (`ModelDoc2?`)
- Consistent error handling patterns across all document operations
- Better separation of concerns with dedicated cleanup helper methods
- Improved logging and user feedback during cleanup operations
- More defensive programming practices with multiple fallback strategies

The fixes ensure that SolidWorks documents are properly closed and COM resources are released, preventing the accumulation of open document instances in the taskbar and improving overall application stability and performance.
